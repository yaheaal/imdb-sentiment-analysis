# 🔍 Sentiment Analysis Project 🤔

This README and all the docstring in the code was written by **ChatGPT**

## 📜 Introduction
Sentiment analysis is the 💻 process of determining the sentiment of a piece of text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral 🤔. In this project, we aim to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of text data 💬. The problem we are trying to solve is to accurately classify the sentiment of the text and gain insights into the underlying data 💡. To achieve this, we propose a solution that involves preprocessing and cleaning the text data 🧼, followed by exploratory data analysis 🔍 to gain insights. The cleaned and preprocessed data will then be used as input to a sentiment analysis model 🧠, which will classify the sentiment of the text. This project will demonstrate the importance of thorough preprocessing and EDA in the overall process of sentiment analysis 🤓.

## 💻 Requirements
**Python 3.9.6**  
I used **Mac m1**. You can use any PC with any operating system, but of course, you must make some changes to the packages 💻  

**Install packages**  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 🏁 Conclusion
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing are crucial steps in any data science project 🤓. In this repository, we focused on cleaning and exploring the text data to gain insights before building the model 🧠. The preprocessing stage is often the most time-consuming part of a project, but it is also one of the most important 💯. Proper preprocessing and cleaning of the data ensures that the model is built on quality data, leading to better results 🤓. In conclusion, the time and effort invested in EDA and preprocessing pays off in the form of a more accurate and robust model 💪. This repository serves as a foundation for further analysis and model building, and demonstrates the importance of thorough preprocessing in any data analysis project 🔍.
